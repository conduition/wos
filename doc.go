/*
Package wos leverages the [Wallet Of Satoshi] REST API to process Bitcoin payments.

[Wallet Of Satoshi] is a custodial bitcoin wallet which is reknowned for its
ease of use. WoS does not provide any documentation on their API, so this
package is mostly reverse-engineered by studying how the WoS API is used in
the wild.

See the [README] for more info.
